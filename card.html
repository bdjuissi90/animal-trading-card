          		The cat is a very adorable and cute animal. He is a domestic animal and is kept as a pet. He has very sharp claws and quick eyes that help him see at night. He has two small ears, with a very sensitive tympanic membrane (eardrum), which helps him hear the slightest of  sounds. The cat is an extremely beautiful and fascinating mammal, which can attract you to it with its laid-back demeanor and amusing depiction of its actions.
